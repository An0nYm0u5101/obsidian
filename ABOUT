About Obsidian
==============

Obsidian is a Peer To Peer software that enables mass mirroring, ensuring fully automatic and highly reactive data replication between its Nodes. 
Designed to share great amounts of files across TCP/IP Networks, Obsidian is using DEXP (Documents Exchange Protocol), a protocol specifically designed to exchange documents between multiple peers, enabling knowledge to spread as fast as possible across the net. 

Technical Principle
===================

Obsidian listens to specific filesystem events then propagates its 
modifications by pushing them across All its peers. When a dexp reposiroy is 
modified, its modification get replicated almost instantly (depending of 
modifications amount and bandwith between the different peers).

Note: For now Obsidian is an experimental Software, use it at your own risks.
