Installing Obsidian
===================

Software dependancies:

libssl-dev
inotify ( That's why dexp is for now Linux Only ! )


Build Procedure:
================

In order to build Obsidian, you will need the CMake tool to create the appropriate Makefile. Once in the Obsidian root directory, start the Makefile creation by typing "cmake ."

If the Makefile creation went OK, then just type "make" to start the 
compilation process. Finally, when the dexp build is finished, type "make install" to copy the necessary files from the build directory to your own system.

That's all :)
